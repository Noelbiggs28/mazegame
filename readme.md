A little maze game I made to help me study before I had any training.
I continued working on in while in class to reenforce what I learned and
because of this some things are wonky because instead of finding the right 
tool for the job. I tried to find uses for the tools.

maze algorithm using an algorithm from chat gpt then tweaked for my purposes
music from freesound.org
sounds from bfxr
images from how to make an rpg e-book
- I drew the heart and key in gimp in case it wasnt obvious
state machine skeleton from Ian Rufus youtube video


to do list:
-add multiple choice
send correct questions to new list. recycle wrong questions to original list to be asked again
-create sprite sheet from all my images
add more images to sprite sheet

-figure out states
-figure out how to split these into multiple files for a cleaner look. keep -getting errors everythings so dependant and interconnected
add ability to choose from multiple files
-add ability to add name to high score
display high scores in the end and maybe on startup
-add consequences for losing all hearts
